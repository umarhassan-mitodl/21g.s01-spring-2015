Through the semester you will complete **3** short response essays about the assigned readings. In one double-spaced page you will:

1.  Write one or two paragraphs in which you will present your hypothesis or thesis about an aspect of the assigned readings.
2.  Write the body of the response essay; here you will present the arguments that support the point **'a'** based on a textual criticism or a theoretical argument.
    

Each short response essay should be handed in at the beginning of the class discussion in which the assigned readings will be discussed.
